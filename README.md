Any `List` structures used will be implemented as an `ArrayList`.

`Domino` class &mdash; `HALF_BLANK` object:

As commented in the `Domino` class, the static `HALF_BLANK` object was created to store some sort of object that would hold the shifted position of a half domino. It is not meant to be used as a real domino (as such, the code should ignore it when counting the dots and the dominos themselves in each player's trays).
